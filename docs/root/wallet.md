# Zen Wallet

There are currently 2 ways to access your Zen Wallet and make transactions:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Full Node Desktop Wallet](wallet/desktop-wallet.html)

This is the most secure way to validate the network, use your wallet to make transaction and run smart contracts. It takes more time to sync up with the network, but the result is a higher level of security.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [Web Wallet (Beta)](wallet/web-wallet.html)

This option is easier to use and does not require time to sync up with the network, but is less secure and more vulnerable to attack.
