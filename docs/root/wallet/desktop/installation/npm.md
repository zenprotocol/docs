## Running with arguments

### Wipe (Clear Data)

When we launch a new testnet sometimes you will need to wipe your local database in order to sync.

Note that this will NOT delete any data/tokens from the wallet.

You can do this by running: ```zen-wallet wipe```

### Full Wipe  (Clear Data and wallet)

To completely wipe the blockchain + the wallet from your computer run: ```zen-wallet wipefull```
Running without full node

If you would like to run the node independently in a separate tab you can run zen-wallet uionly to launch the wallet without the full node running in the background.
