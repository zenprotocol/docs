# ZF*

Documentation for the ZF* (pronounced "Z-F-Star") dialect of F*

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ZF* is the smart contracting language for the Zen Protocol.
ZF* is a dialect of the F* language.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning to develop with ZF*, it is worth developing familiarity with a statically typed functional language, such as F#, OCaml, or Haskell.

It's worth skimming through the F* tutorial. Note that the F* tutorial also assumes familiarity with F#, OCaml, or Haskell.
